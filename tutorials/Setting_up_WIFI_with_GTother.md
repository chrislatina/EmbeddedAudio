# Setting up WIFI with GTother

** This tutorial is still in progress **

The goal of this tutorial is to document how to get on the WIFI at Georgia Tech with Raspberry Pi. This is intended for student developers.

## Caveats
	* While I did get this to work, I didn't fully document my steps. I remember booting the OS using startx and simply using the WIFI GUI.
	* Most importantly, one needs to register their device with OIT (you need to bring it there and give them the MAC Address). Once registered, you can authenticate by going to [https://auth.lawn.gatech.edu/index.php](https://auth.lawn.gatech.edu/index.php) using the GTOther network.
	* Note: to find the MAC address use the command ```ifconfig```

	If you are running headless (see [Sharing your network with Pi (OSX)](Sharing_your_network_with_Pi_(OSX).md)) this is simple. Otherwise you will need to connect a USB Keyboard and a Monitor to display the terminal output.
