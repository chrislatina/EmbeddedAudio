# Compiling SuperCollider with PortAudio

** This tutorial is still in progress **

The goal of this tutorial is to recompile SuperCollider with the PortAudio flag in order to do Capture and Playback with a USB Audio interface without depending on the Jack Driver. My attempts at following the references below were not successful. I plan to return to this at a later time.
